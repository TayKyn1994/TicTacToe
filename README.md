# TicTacToe
Code summary and README for the interactive TicTacToe Game I created.

This project was created with HTML, CSS and used JavaScript to animate the game. It may beat you at TicTacToe! JavaScript was used to add the animation and the sound effects for the game. I learned so much from this project regarding how to use JavaScript to make something genuinely user friendly. 

# Tasks
## 1. Create an HTML template 
For this task I created an HTML template that included script source tags to link to the CSS and JavaScript files.

## 2. Create a CSS file
I created a CSS file and included all of the styling elements that were required to make the game look how I wanted it to.

## 3. Create a JavaScript file
I created a JS file that would include buttons and sound effects that would happen in response to a button being clicked.

# Conclusion
All of the screenshots included show the exact codes and steps I took to create the game. Before this project I did not possess the skills to create a project that was responsive/interactive but now that I know what I know, I can see myself creating more projects similar to this one. It was a fun project and I hope you enjoy it!
